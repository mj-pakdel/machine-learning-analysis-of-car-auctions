# machine-learning-analysis-of-car-auctions
An external client at KBB is interested to know how the probability of sell of each offer is impacted by auction and car characteristics. There are four main questions to investigate: ● Q1) How the probability of sell of each offering is impacted by the floor price(with respect to MMR (Manheim Market Report))? ● Q2) What the other factors impact the probability of sell? ● Q3) What is the probability of sell? ● Q4) What is the accuracy of the model?
