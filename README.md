# machine-learning-analysis-of-car-auctions
An external client at company x is interested to know how the probability of sell of each offer is impacted by auction and car characteristics. There are four main questions to investigate: 

● Q1) How the probability of sell of each offering is impacted by the floor price(with respect to MMR (Manheim Market Report))? 
● Q2) What the other factors impact the probability of sell?     
● Q3) What is the probability of sell?     
● Q4) What is the accuracy of the model?
